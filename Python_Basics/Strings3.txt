The Modi government, under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, has been marked by a series of transformative policies and initiatives aimed at fostering economic growth, infrastructure development, and digital innovation. Since taking office in 2014, Modi's administration has embarked on a mission to redefine India's development model and enhance its global standing.

One of the key areas of focus has been economic reform. The government introduced the Goods and Services Tax (GST), which streamlined the tax system and eliminated the problem of cascading tax. This reform has succeeded in expanding the government's tax base, although it has also faced challenges, including initial disruptions and a temporary slowdown in GDP growth. The Modi government also launched the "Make in India" initiative to boost manufacturing and attract foreign direct investment, followed by the production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme in 2023 to further stimulate domestic production in key sectors like electronics and drones.

Infrastructure development has been another cornerstone of Modi's tenure. The government has made significant strides in expanding transportation networks, including the growth of operational airports from 74 to 160 between 2014 and 2025 under the UDAN scheme, which aims to bring air connectivity to remote towns. Additionally, the Smart Cities Mission has driven urban transformation with over 8,000 projects and investments worth Rs 1.64 lakh crore. The Delhi Metro has expanded into one of the largest and most efficient metro systems globally, setting benchmarks for mass rapid transit in the country, now reaching 15 Indian cities.

Digital innovation has also been a priority, with the government emphasizing the importance of digital public goods. The Aadhaar digital ID system, linked to fingerprints and iris scans, has enrolled roughly 99% of Indian adults, facilitating more efficient delivery of public services. The Modi government has also focused on expanding digital connectivity and promoting initiatives like Mission LiFE, which encourages sustainable lifestyles through reducing, reusing, and recycling.

In terms of social welfare, the government has implemented various programs aimed at improving the lives of ordinary Indians. Over 81 crore people receive free food grains, and millions benefit from housing, water, and financial assistance. The government has also prioritized inclusive progress, with 60% of Union ministers hailing from SC, ST, and OBC categories.

However, challenges remain. Despite economic growth, the Modi government has faced criticism for not creating enough productive jobs outside of agriculture, particularly for the large proportion of India's labor force that is unskilled and poor. Around 40% of workers remain in agriculture, and only about 20% work in manufacturing jobs or business services such as IT. The government has acknowledged the need to convert higher growth into productive jobs and curb the excess wealth of economic and political elites.
