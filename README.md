# üß† Data Science Learning Journey:

Welcome to my personal learning repository on **Data Science Fundamentals**. This repo tracks my hands-on progression from raw Python basics to structured numerical computing with NumPy‚Äîupdated consistently as I learn, experiment, and grow.

## üìö Repository Overview

This project is structured in two evolving parts:

### üìÅ 1. Python_Basics/
My foundational Python scripts and practice sets. These cover:

| üìÇ File/Module                   | üí° Concept Covered                              |
|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `Data_Types.py`                 | Numbers, strings, booleans, and type operations |
| `Dictionary_Basics.py`          | Dictionary CRUD and nesting                     |
| `File_Handling_Basics.py`       | Reading, writing, and manipulating files        |
| `List_Basics.py` + `List_Practice_Set.py` | List methods and challenges          |
| `Loops_In_Python.py`           | `for`, `while`, and control flow mechanisms     |
| `Set_Basics.py`                 | Set theory in Python                            |
| `Strings.py` + `StringsX.txt`   | String formatting, slicing, and challenges      |
| `Practice_Set_File_Handling.py` | File-based I/O exercises                        |
| `All_DS_Basic_Problems.py`      | Collection of beginner-friendly DS problems     |

> Supplementary `.txt` files contain extra exercises and reference examples.

### üìÅ 2. NumPy_Tutorial/
This is a progressively expanding set of well-documented notes and hands-on code snippets that capture my NumPy learning.

üìò Topics include:

- Array creation, attributes, and indexing (2D & 3D)
- Broadcasting and slicing mechanics
- Mathematical operations (element-wise, matrix algebra, stats)
- Array reshaping, stacking, and splitting
- Random number generation & identity matrices
- Advanced indexing (integer, boolean)
- Axis logic and conceptual broadcast rules
- Real-world use cases in Data Science

üßæ All notes are written in a learner-friendly tone and posted every alternate day, with examples, syntax breakdowns, and edge case handling.

## üí° Why This Project?

To become fluent in Data Science, I decided to:

- **Learn Python from first principles**  
- **Document every step** to reinforce retention and provide open learning notes  
- **Build problem-solving intuition** through practice sets  
- **Solidify NumPy** as the bridge to more advanced libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-Learn

This repo reflects my raw process‚Äîtrial and mastery through code and notes.

## How to Clone this Repository and use it

1. Clone the repo to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/Data-Science-Learning.git
   cd Data-Science-Learning
2. Navigate to Python_Basics/ to refresh your Python fundamentals.
3. Head into NumPy_Tutorial.txt to dive into structured numerical computing.
4. Copy, edit, and execute code examples to explore further. The scripts are self-contained and beginner-friendly.
5. Expect ongoing updates!


## Conclusion

 -  Structured Curiosity: I began with core Python, emphasizing fundamentals before touching libraries. This has made it easier to understand ‚Äúwhy‚Äù behind NumPy, not just ‚Äúhow.‚Äù
 -  Depth Over Speed: Instead of rushing through tutorials, I prioritized deep note-taking and daily iteration. Every example here comes from hours of breaking, fixing, and rebuilding code.

## Feedback

 - Open to Feedback: I‚Äôm always looking to improve‚Äînot just technically, but also in how I organize and communicate ideas. If you see anything that could be clearer or more optimized, feel free to suggest !
