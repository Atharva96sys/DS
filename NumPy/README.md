# 📘 NumPy Tutorial Notes

Welcome to my personal NumPy learning log! 👨‍💻✨  
This repository documents my hands-on journey through the powerful Python NumPy library—shared one update at a time, every other day. Whether you're just starting out or brushing up on array operations, these notes break down everything I learn in a concise and approachable format. 
With Most Of The Things Derived From Lecture Videos, Numpy Documentation and My Own Curiosity to help under Numpy Basic And Advanced Easily.

## 🔍 What's Inside

Each update includes detailed notes on:

- **Array creation and initialization**
- **Attributes** like `ndim`, `shape`, `dtype`, `itemsize`, `nbytes`, etc.
- **Indexing & slicing (2D, 3D, advanced, boolean, integer)**
- **Array reshaping, stacking, and splitting**
- **Math operations** (element-wise, broadcasting, linear algebra, statistics)
- **Random arrays, identity matrices, and memory management**
- **Practical examples & edge case behavior**

## 📗 How to Use

These are progressive notes structured to mirror how someone might learn NumPy from scratch:
- Read it sequentially (start with Day 1) OR
- Jump to any concept—each section is self-contained
- Copy & paste the code to experiment and tweak in your own IDE

## 🧠 Why This Exists

I created this repo to:
- Reinforce my own understanding through consistent documentation
- Share concepts that are often overlooked or poorly explained elsewhere
- Help others (like you!) make sense of NumPy through real working examples

## 🚀 Next Steps

Soon I'll be adding:
- Benchmarking examples with performance notes
- Visual explanations of broadcasting and dimensional expansion
- Links to helpful community resources and notebooks

🧮 Learning never stops. Arrays just get larger.
